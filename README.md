# customersclub
This is a flutter + nodejs app that allows bars to register customers to their customers club. Once the member is registered, he receives an email with a QR code that he can display to the barman with the app each time he buys a beer. The barman then scans the QR and a beer is added to the overall beers the customer drank in the past.
